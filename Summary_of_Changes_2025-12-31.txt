              TARGETSLIVE CHATBOT - DAILY TASK LOG (December 31, 2025)
================================================================================

================================================================================
                              TASK 1: AUTO-QUOTING REMOVAL
================================================================================

STATUS: DROPPED (Due to Ambiguity)

DESCRIPTION:
The original goal was to automatically wrap important keywords (like "Region",
"Add", "Search") in single quotes in the JSON editor so that they would appear
bold in the chatbot interface.

WHAT WAS IMPLEMENTED:
- A `PORTAL_TERM_BANK` constant containing a list of terms to be quoted.
- An `AutoQuoter` JavaScript object with an `apply()` method that would wrap
  matching terms in single quotes.
- Integration with the `exportJSON()` function to apply quoting on save.

WHY IT WAS DROPPED:
- The logic was causing ambiguity and over-quoting in some cases.
- It was difficult to distinguish between terms that should be quoted and
  those that shouldn't (e.g., "Add" as a button vs "add" as a verb).
- The feature was interfering with user intent.

FUTURE PLAN:
- Will come up with a better solution to automatically bold keywords at the
  frontend (chatbot display) rather than storing quotes in the JSON data.
- Potential approach: Use a dictionary lookup to bold recognized terms during
  rendering, not during data entry.

                         TASK 2: LATENCY OPTIMIZATION
================================================================================

STATUS: COMPLETED

PROBLEM:
The chatbot was experiencing high latency (6-12 seconds per response) due to
multiple sequential LLM API calls.

SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:
1. Created a unified `RequestAnalyzer` class that combines Intent Classification
   and Language Detection into a single LLM call (previously 2 separate calls).
2. Removed the redundant `_generate_step_summary` LLM call in the TutorialAgent.
   Replaced it with static template-based summaries.
3. Updated the LangGraph workflow topology to use the new merged node.

RESULTS:
- Reduced LLM calls per request from 4 to 2.
- Average response time improved to ~3.8s for general queries and ~5.5s for
  tutorials.

                        TASK 3: TYPING ANIMATION (UI/UX)
================================================================================

STATUS: COMPLETED

PROBLEM:
Bot responses appeared instantly as a large block of text, which felt
"aggressive" and not user-friendly.

SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:
1. Created a `typeWriter()` JavaScript function that displays text character
   by character with a configurable speed.
2. Modified the `addMessage()` function to:
   - Type out the main text content first.
   - Then fade in complex elements (steps, images, suggestion buttons).
3. Added CSS animation class `.fade-in` for smooth transitions.
4. Tuned the animation speed (30ms per character, 1 char per frame) for
   optimal aesthetics.

                          TASK 4: 404 ERROR FIX
================================================================================

STATUS: COMPLETED

PROBLEM:
Server logs showed 404 errors for missing files:
- /design.css
- /Icon.png

SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:
1. Removed the broken `<link rel="stylesheet" href="design.css" />` reference.
2. Replaced the missing `Icon.png` image with a robot emoji (🤖).

FILES MODIFIED:
- templates/index_chatbot.html
