Summary of Work - December 30, 2025

1. UI Enhancements (JSON Editor):
   - Improved the delete buttons in Tutorial JSON Builder.
   - Replaced icon-only buttons with clear text labels: "Delete Section" and "Delete Step".
   - Ensured button labels remain consistent when steps are added or removed dynamically.

2. Enhanced Success Feedback System:
   - Modified the indexing system (ingest.py) to produce clear, layman-friendly logs.
   - Added tracking for new, updated, and removed tutorial sections.
   - Updated the frontend UI to display a comprehensive success message after saving:
     - Confirms the exact file saved (name, tutorial title, and time).
     - Lists specifically what MIRA learned, updated, or cleaned up.
     - Shows the final count of tutorial steps MIRA now knows.

3. Preparation for Dynamic Keyword System:
   - Researched the hardcoded keyword auto-quoting system.
   - Prepared a technical plan to make keywords dynamic based on your tutorial content.
   - Created 'todo_tomorrow.txt' to track the next steps for this feature.
