Summary of Improvements - December 29, 2025
============================================

Today, we successfully enhanced MIRA's intelligence, performance, and user interface. Below is a summary of the key changes:

1. Chatbot Capabilities & Suggestions
------------------------------------
* Fixed an issue where "Suggested Actions" (next-step buttons) were not appearing after MIRA explained its functions.
* Updated 'index_chatbot.html' to correctly render these suggestions in both English and Roman Urdu.

2. User Interface Enhancements (JSON Editor)
-------------------------------------------
* Modernized the Vector Database section in 'index_edit_json.html'.
* Simplified technical terminology for a better layman experience:
    - "Vector Database Management" -> "Update MIRA's Knowledge"
    - "Update Vector Database" -> "Teach MIRA Now"
    - Technical logs like "Syncing..." replaced with "MIRA is learning your changes..."
* Redesigned the success message: It is now a large, premium green box with a celebratory layout and clear icons.

3. Performance Optimization & Speed
----------------------------------
* Implemented "Incremental Indexing" in 'ingest.py' using content hashing.
* MIRA now only processes sections that have actually changed since the last update.
* Reduced the update time from several minutes to just a few seconds for typical changes.
* Added automatic deletion of stale records in the database when JSON files are removed.

4. System Robustness & Stability
-------------------------------
* Fixed a "hanging" issue in the backend ('app.py') by ensuring it robustly finds the local virtual environment (.venv) python interpreter.
* Added unbuffered logging (flush=True) to 'ingest.py' for better real-time progress tracking in the dashboard.

Files Modified:
- app.py
- ingest.py
- templates/index_chatbot.html
- templates/index_edit_json.html

The system is now faster, more stable, and more user-friendly. MIRA is ready to help users with its updated knowledge!
