MIRA Chatbot Development Summary - January 8, 2026

Today's session focused on optimizing performance, enhancing user experience, and improving MIRA's contextual self-awareness.

1. DATABASE & ARCHITECTURE IMPROVEMENTS
- Timezone Correction: Fixed the issue where timestamps defaulted to UTC. All session updates now use local Pakistan time (PKT).
- Foreign Key Integrity: Enabled 'PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON' to ensure cascading deletions work correctly. Deleting a session now purges all related history.
- Database Reset: Successfully performed a full cleanup of the 'Session' and 'SessionInformation' tables for a clean production state.

2. PERFORMANCE & EFFICIENCY UPGRADES
- Metadata-Driven Knowledge Discovery: Upgraded the 'KnowledgeBase' to query ChromaDB metadata instead of scanning JSON files. This reduces disk I/O and ensures perfect synchronization between suggested topics and actual indexed content.
- Triggered Refreshes: Optimized the AI's internal memory refresh to happen only after a vector database update, significantly reducing redundant processing.

3. USER EXPERIENCE (UX) ENHANCEMENTS
- Custom Confirmation Modal: Replaced the generic browser 'confirm()' dialog with a custom glassmorphism modal with clear warnings and premium styling.
- Lazy Session Creation: Implemented logic where "New Chat" entries only appear in the sidebar after the first message is sent, preventing clutter from empty sessions.
- Personalized Tutorial Greetings: MIRA now generates dynamic, context-aware introductions (e.g., "Here are the steps to add a region:") instead of generic hardcoded text.

4. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE & CONTEXTUAL SELF-AWARENESS
- Advanced Contextual Memory: Integrated a 'HistorySummaryAgent' that allows MIRA to recall previous user questions (e.g., "What was my last question?") and provide full discussion recaps.
- Intent Detection Refinement: Improved the 'RequestAnalyzer' to correctly classify specific instructional requests (e.g., "View details of Wallet") as 'tutorial' intent rather than general capabilities.
- Contextual Step Clarification: Fixed a data-bridging bug in 'app.py' that now allows MIRA to successfully explain specific steps of a previously given answer.

5. REPOSITORY MANAGEMENT
- Successfully pushed the optimized codebase to GitHub with the commit: "Resolved the issues related to the latency. Now the response has been improved."

System state: Robust, efficient, and contextually aware.
