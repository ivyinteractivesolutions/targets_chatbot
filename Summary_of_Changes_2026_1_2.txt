SUMMARY OF CHANGES - JANUARY 2, 2026

Today's work focused on enhancing the chatbot's functionality, optimizing the codebase, and planning for critical security and scaling improvements.

1. SESSION MANAGEMENT ENHANCEMENTS (COMPLETED)
   - Feature: Added ability to Delete and Rename chat sessions directly from the sidebar.
   - Backend: Implemented delete_session and rename_session methods in session_manager.py using SQLite.
   - API: Added DELETE and PUT /sessions/<id> endpoints in app.py.
   - UI: Updated index_chatbot.html with edit (pencil) and delete (trash) icons on hover.
   - UX: Added confirmation prompts for deletion to prevent accidental data loss.

2. CODE REFACTORING & OPTIMIZATION (COMPLETED)
   - Validation Logic: Extracted redundant tutorial data validation into a new helper function validate_tutorial_data in app.py.
   - Frontend Extraction: Improved maintainability by moving over 1,000 lines of inline CSS and JavaScript from index_chatbot.html into external files:
     - static/css/chat.css
     - static/js/chat_logic.js
   - Cleanup: Pruned obsolete file-system session logic from session_manager.py following the SQLite migration.

3. SECURITY & SCALING PLANNING (IN PROGRESS)
   - Comprehensive Security Plan: Developed a strategy to address Path Traversal, XSS, CORS, and Access Control.
   - Scaling & Latency: Outlined performance improvements including:
     - Enabling SQLite Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) for better concurrency.
     - Implementing Security Headers (CSP, XSS Protection).
     - Adding Rate Limiting to prevent abuse.
   - Artifacts: Documented the technical roadmap in implementation_plan.md and implementation_plan.txt.

NEXT STEPS
- Implement Security Hardening (Path Traversal, XSS, CORS).
- Optimize Database for Concurrency (WAL Mode).
- Conduct Verification and Load Testing.
